          world traffic. As well as that we want to see how the community reacts
          to the idea of a community network that is capable or providing them
          with free internet.

        <h4>What can I do here?</h4>
        <p>
          With this being our now little private network, Imagine yourself being in a space
          completely separated from the Internet,That doesnâ€™t meant thereâ€™s nothing
          to do here. In the top right corner you will see a nice selection of
          applications and pages you can visit and mess around with. As well as
          that feel free to explore all the posts we have in the bottom section
          of this page ðŸ˜†
